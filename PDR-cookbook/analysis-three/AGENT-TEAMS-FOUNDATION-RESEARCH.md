## ü§ñ **CURRENT AGENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Agent Teams Page Implementation**
**Primary File:** `ClientAgentTeamsPage.tsx` - Complete agent teams interface  
**Supporting Components:**
- `LiveAgentActivity.tsx` - Real-time agent monitoring dashboard component
- `agent-teams-architecture.md` - Comprehensive agent system documentation

### **Current Agent System (lines 24-73)**
```typescript
const agents: Agent[] = [
  {
    id: 'design-agent',
    name: 'Design Agent',
    role: 'UI/UX Specialist',
    status: 'working',
    currentTask: 'Creating responsive layouts for mobile devices',
    progress: 65,
    icon: Palette,
    tasksCompleted: 23,
    efficiency: 94
  },
  // Code Agent, AI Agent, Security Agent...
];
```

**FINDING:** Current implementation uses placeholder/mock agent data, NOT real system integration

## üèóÔ∏è **REAL-TIME DATA INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES**

### **LiveAgentActivity Component Analysis (lines 44-45)**
```typescript
// Use real data from Supabase
const agentActivities = dashboardData?.agentActivities || [];
```

**Integration Points:**
- `useClientDetails()` - Client context
- `useDashboardData()` - Real-time dashboard data  
- Supabase subscription for live updates
- 30-second auto-refresh interval

**FINDING:** Infrastructure exists for real agent data integration

### **Token and Performance Tracking**
**Current Metrics (lines 56-62):**
- Token usage tracking (`tokensUsed`)
- Progress percentage monitoring
- Active agent counts
- Task completion statistics
- Estimated completion times

**FINDING:** Framework exists for comprehensive agent performance metrics

---

## ü§ñ **MOCK VS REAL DATA COMPARISON**

### **Current Mock Data (ClientAgentTeamsPage.tsx)**
```typescript
// Simulated activity - lines 78-95
const activityMessages = [
  'Design Agent completed color palette optimization',
  'Code Agent pushed new authentication module',
  'AI Agent achieved 92% accuracy on test data'
];
```

**Mock Characteristics:**
- 4 generic agents (Design, Code, AI, Security)
- Simulated activity updates every 5 seconds
- Placeholder metrics and tasks
- No connection to actual SISO work

### **Real Agent Integration Requirements**
**Needed Data Sources:**
- Actual agent system APIs
- Real task assignments and completions
- Live work status from agent orchestration
- Completed work artifacts and analysis
- Agent collaboration patterns
