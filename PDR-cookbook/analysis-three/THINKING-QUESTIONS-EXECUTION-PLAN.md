## üìù **PHASE 2: ASSUMPTION-DOCUMENTED ANSWER FORMAT**

### **TEMPLATE FOR EACH THINKING QUESTION:**
```markdown
## QUESTION: [Original Question]

### ANSWER:
[Strategic answer based on foundation research + logical reasoning]

### ASSUMPTIONS:
üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (could change fundamental approach):
- [Assumption about user behavior/business model/technical constraints]
- [Assumption that affects core strategy]

üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (affects specific features):
- [Assumption about feature preferences]
- [Assumption about implementation details]

üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (minor details only):
- [Assumption about styling/aesthetics]
- [Assumption about edge case handling]

### CONFIDENCE LEVEL: [High/Medium/Low]
### VALIDATION NEEDED: [Specific research required for high-priority assumptions]
```

---

## üéØ **PHASE 3: VALIDATION PRIORITY MATRIX**

### **HIGH PRIORITY VALIDATION (Must Research):**
- Business model assumptions (affects overall strategy)
- User behavior assumptions (affects design approach)
- Technical constraint assumptions (affects feasibility)
- Client success definition assumptions (affects metrics)

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY VALIDATION (Research if Time Allows):**
- Feature preference assumptions (can be A/B tested)
- Implementation detail assumptions (can be iterated)
- Integration complexity assumptions (affects timeline)

### **LOW PRIORITY VALIDATION (Document but Don't Research):**
- UI styling assumptions (easy to change)
- Edge case handling assumptions (iterate as needed)
- Aesthetic preference assumptions (subjective)
