## üó£Ô∏è The SISO Pitch

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"I work with an AI development company that builds professional websites in 24-48 hours for 90% less than traditional agencies. We just completed a $25,000 e-commerce site for $2,997 and delivered it in 2 days instead of 8 weeks. Would you be interested in seeing how we could help your business?"*

### Problem Agitation (60 seconds)
*"Most businesses face the same dilemma: DIY website builders like Wix make you do all the work yourself and look amateur. Traditional agencies charge $10,000-50,000 and take 2-6 months. Freelancers might disappear mid-project. There hasn't been a good option... until now."*

### Solution Presentation (90 seconds)
*"SISO uses AI agents to build custom websites and apps in 24-48 hours. Our AI analyzes your top competitors, creates better designs, and builds everything custom. You get agency-quality work at DIY prices, with a 12-month warranty that no one else offers. Here's exactly how it works..."*

### Proof Points (60 seconds)
*"We've built [X] websites in the past month, saving clients over $[Y] compared to agency quotes. Our average project cost is $1,497 vs $15,000 for agencies. Every client gets delivered in 24-48 hours vs 6-8 weeks. And if anything breaks in 12 months, we fix it free."*

### Close (30 seconds)
*"The best part? You can try us completely risk-free. Your first project is FREE up to 5 pages, delivered in 48 hours. If you're not amazed by the quality and speed, you owe nothing. Should we schedule 30 minutes to show you exactly what we can build for your business?"*

---

## ‚ùì Objection Handling

### "It sounds too good to be true"
**Response:** *"I understand the skepticism. That's exactly why we offer the first project free. You can see the quality and speed yourself with zero risk. Plus, we're the only company confident enough to offer a 12-month warranty. When you see what AI can do in 24 hours, you'll understand why we can offer these prices."*

### "How can it be so much cheaper?"
**Response:** *"Traditional agencies have 10-20 employees, expensive overhead, and manual processes. Our AI agents work 24/7 with no salaries, no benefits, no office space. We pass those savings directly to you. You're paying for the result, not the overhead."*

### "What if I need changes?"
**Response:** *"Every project includes 3-5 revisions depending on complexity. Major changes are handled as separate projects at the same fair rates. But here's the key - our AI analyzes your competitors and your preferences upfront, so we typically get it right the first time. Plus, you have 12 months of warranty coverage."*

### "How do I know you'll still be here in a year?"
**Response:** *"That's exactly why we offer the 12-month warranty - we're confident in our longevity. We're backed by [funding/revenue details], growing [X]% monthly, and our AI technology is years ahead of competitors. But the warranty protects you either way."*

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:** *"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific concerns can I address? Remember, your first project is completely free, so there's no risk in trying us. Would it help to see a few examples of websites we've built for businesses like yours?"*

### "We don't have the budget right now"
**Response:** *"I understand budget concerns. That's why most of our clients switch to us - we save them 90% vs agencies. What were you planning to spend? I bet we can deliver something better for less than you expected. Plus, you can pay 50% now and 50% on delivery."*
