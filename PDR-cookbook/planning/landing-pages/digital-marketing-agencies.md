**The Solution:**
SISO becomes your development arm. We handle all website and app development using AI agents that work 10x faster than traditional developers. You maintain the client relationship, we deliver the technology, and you earn 20% commission on every development project - forever.

Your clients get integrated marketing and development solutions from one trusted partner (you), while you earn both your marketing fees and ongoing development commissions without any technical headaches.
