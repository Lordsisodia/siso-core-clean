Unlike generic practice management systems, we understand veterinary workflows. Our AI agents build your solution specifically for your practice specialties, protocols, and client base in just 20 hours.

### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You became a veterinarian to heal animals and support families, not to spend your evenings managing paper records and chasing clients for follow-up appointments. Every day brings scheduling conflicts, missing medical histories, and clients who forget their pet's treatment plan. You're juggling appointment books, medical records, inventory sheets, and trying to provide excellent care while managing a business.

Meanwhile, pet parents want transparency. They want to book appointments online, access their pet's medical history, receive reminders for vaccinations, and communicate with your team easily. They want to understand their pet's treatment plan and feel confident in your care. But your current system forces them to call during business hours and limits their access to information.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete veterinary practice platform in 20 hours. Pet parents can book appointments anytime through your custom mobile app, access their pet's complete medical history, and receive automated care reminders. You have instant access to patient records, treatment protocols, and inventory levels. No more lost files or missed follow-ups.

Our AI agents analyze your specific practice - your specialties, appointment types, common treatments, and local market - then build a custom solution that works exactly how you practice veterinary medicine.
