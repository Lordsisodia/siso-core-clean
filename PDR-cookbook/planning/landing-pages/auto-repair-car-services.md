### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You became a mechanic to fix cars and help people, not to spend your evenings explaining why repairs cost so much and chasing customers who never come back. Every day you battle customer skepticism, try to explain complex issues over the phone, and wonder why people don't trust your recommendations.

Meanwhile, your customers want transparency. They want to see what's wrong with their car, understand why repairs are needed, and know when their vehicle will be ready. They want to schedule service online and pay with their phone. But your current system forces them to take your word for everything and hope you're honest.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete auto shop platform in 20 hours. You can show customers exactly what's wrong with photo and video documentation, send them detailed estimates instantly, and keep them updated throughout the repair process. They see their service history, upcoming maintenance needs, and can schedule their next visit online.

Our AI agents analyze your specific shop - your services, equipment, customer demographics, and workflow - then build a custom solution that makes you the most trusted shop in your area.
