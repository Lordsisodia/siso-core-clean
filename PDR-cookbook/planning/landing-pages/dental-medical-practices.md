### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You became a healthcare provider to heal patients, not to spend your evenings managing appointment books and chasing no-shows. Every day starts with wondering which patients won't show up and how you'll fill those slots. Your staff spends hours on the phone scheduling appointments, verifying insurance, and following up on billing.

Meanwhile, your patients want convenience. They want to book appointments online at midnight, receive automatic reminders, and communicate securely about their care. They want to pay their bills online and access their health records. But your current system forces them to call during business hours and wait on hold.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete, HIPAA-compliant practice management platform in 20 hours. Your patients can book appointments anytime, receive automatic reminders, and communicate securely through your custom patient portal. You see real-time analytics on patient flow, revenue trends, and practice efficiency.

Our AI agents analyze your specific practice - your specialties, patient demographics, insurance mix, and workflow - then build a custom solution that integrates with your existing systems while meeting all compliance requirements.
