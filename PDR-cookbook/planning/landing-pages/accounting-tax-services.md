**The SISO Difference:**
Unlike generic accounting software, we understand CPA practice operations. Our AI agents build your solution specifically for your service mix, seasonal patterns, and client base in just 20 hours.

### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You became a CPA to help clients with their financial success, not to spend January through April in survival mode, working 80-hour weeks while fielding constant "where's my return?" phone calls. Every tax season becomes a test of endurance, with disorganized client documents, manual data entry, and the stress of managing extreme workload spikes.

Meanwhile, your clients expect modern service. They want to upload documents securely, track their return status, and get updates without calling. They want year-round access to their financial information and advisory services. But your current systems force them into your seasonal workflow and administrative burden.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete accounting practice management platform in 20 hours. Your clients upload documents securely, track return progress in real-time, and receive automated updates. You streamline workflows, automate data extraction, and track time accurately. Peak season becomes manageable while off-season advisory services grow your revenue.

Our AI agents analyze your specific practice - your service mix, seasonal patterns, client types, and growth goals - then build a custom solution that works exactly how you practice accounting.
