### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You got into construction to build things and solve problems, not to spend your evenings fielding client calls asking "When will it be done?" and "Why does this cost more?" Every project brings scheduling conflicts, material delays, and clients who want constant updates. You're juggling crew schedules, supplier deliveries, client expectations, and trying to complete quality work on time and on budget.

Meanwhile, your clients want transparency. They want to see progress photos, understand timeline changes, approve change orders easily, and feel confident their project is moving forward. They want to communicate with you efficiently without interrupting your work. But your current system relies on phone calls, text messages, and hoping everyone stays informed.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete construction management platform in 20 hours. Clients get automatic progress updates with photos, transparent billing, and easy change order approval. You have real-time visibility into crew schedules, material deliveries, and project progress. No more surprise phone calls or payment delays.

Our AI agents analyze your specific business - your trade specialties, typical projects, client types, and local market - then build a custom solution that works exactly how you run projects.
