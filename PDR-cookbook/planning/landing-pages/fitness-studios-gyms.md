### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You started your fitness studio to transform lives and build a healthy community. Instead, you're spending your days managing spreadsheets, chasing no-shows, and watching new members disappear after a few weeks. Your trainers are frustrated with scheduling chaos, and you're working 60-hour weeks just to keep the lights on.

Meanwhile, your members want convenience. They want to book classes on their phone, track their progress, connect with other members, and see real results. But your current system forces them to call during business hours, remember their own progress, and hope their favorite class isn't full.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete fitness studio platform in 20 hours. Your members can book classes, join waitlists, track workouts, and connect with your community through your custom mobile app. You see real-time analytics on member engagement, class popularity, and revenue trends.

Our AI agents analyze your specific studio - your class types, peak times, member preferences, and local market - then build a custom solution that helps you build the thriving fitness community you envisioned.
