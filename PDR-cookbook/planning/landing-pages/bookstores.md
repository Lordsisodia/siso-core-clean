# Bookstores: Literary Community Hubs for the Digital Age

## Executive Summary

Independent bookstores represent the soul of literary communities, serving as gathering places for readers, writers, and thinkers who value curated discovery, intellectual discourse, and the irreplaceable experience of browsing physical books.
