**The SISO Difference:**
Unlike generic platforms, we understand restaurant operations. Our AI agents build your solution specifically for your menu, workflow, and customer base in just 20 hours.

### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You opened a restaurant to serve great food, not to pay 30% commissions to tech companies. Every delivery order through third-party platforms costs you $8-15 in fees alone. You're working harder than ever but seeing less profit because your customers belong to someone else's platform.

Meanwhile, you're juggling 5-7 different systems: POS, delivery apps, reservation platform, social media, email marketing, and payment processing. Nothing talks to each other, your customer data is scattered, and you're spending hours on administrative tasks instead of focusing on food and service.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete, integrated restaurant technology platform in 20 hours. One system that handles everything: orders, payments, reservations, loyalty, marketing, and staff management. Your customers order directly from your app and website - no commissions, no middlemen, just profit flowing straight to your restaurant.

Our AI agents analyze your specific needs - your menu, peak times, customer preferences, and local market - then build a custom solution that feels like it was designed specifically for your restaurant. Because it was.

### FAQ Section Addressing Industry Concerns

**Q: How is this different from other restaurant POS systems?**
A: Traditional POS systems just handle transactions. SISO is a complete business platform that includes your own mobile app, website, ordering system, customer management, marketing tools, and analytics - all integrated into one solution that you own.

**Q: What about my existing POS system and kitchen equipment?**
A: SISO integrates with most major POS systems (Square, Toast, Clover) and kitchen display systems. We handle the technical integration during your 20-hour build process.

**Q: How do you build it so fast?**
A: Our AI agents work 24/7 and have built hundreds of restaurant platforms. They use proven templates optimized for restaurants, then customize everything for your specific menu, branding, and workflow.

**Q: What if my customers are used to ordering on DoorDash?**
A: We provide a complete customer migration strategy including incentives for direct ordering, push notifications, and marketing campaigns. Most restaurants see 40-60% of customers switch to direct ordering within 90 days.

**Q: How much will I really save on commissions?**
A: The average restaurant saves $4,000-15,000 monthly. For example, if you do $20,000 in delivery sales monthly through third-party platforms at 25% commission, that's $5,000 in fees. With SISO, you pay $599 and keep the other $4,401.

**Q: What about delivery drivers?**
A: You can use your own delivery staff or integrate with services like DoorDash Drive (driver-only service at 6-10% vs 25-30% full commission). Many restaurants partner with local delivery companies for better rates.

**Q: Is this too complicated for my older staff?**
A: SISO is designed for restaurant workers. Our interfaces are simple, intuitive, and based on workflows your staff already know. We provide training and support to ensure smooth adoption.

**Q: What happens if something breaks during dinner rush?**
A: We provide 24/7 technical support with average response time under 2 minutes. Our system has 99.9% uptime and automatic failsafes. Plus, you can always fall back to traditional ordering methods if needed.
