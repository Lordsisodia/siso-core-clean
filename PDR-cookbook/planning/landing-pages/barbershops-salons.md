**The SISO Difference:**
Unlike generic booking platforms, we understand salon operations. Our AI agents build your solution specifically for your services, pricing, and client base in just 20 hours.

### Problem/Solution Narrative

**The Problem:**
You became a stylist to make people look and feel amazing, not to spend your evenings fielding booking calls and dealing with no-shows. Every day starts with wondering who won't show up and how you'll fill those empty slots. You're juggling appointment books, cash registers, product inventory, and trying to stay active on social media.

Meanwhile, your clients want convenience. They want to book at midnight, see available times instantly, and get reminders so they don't forget. They want to see photos of your work and book their favorite stylist. But your current system forces them to call during business hours and hope you answer.

**The Solution:**
SISO builds you a complete salon management platform in 20 hours. Your clients can book anytime through your custom mobile app, receive automatic reminders, and even reschedule themselves. You see exactly who's coming, when, and for what service. No more surprise cancellations or empty chairs.

Our AI agents analyze your specific salon - your services, peak times, client preferences, and local market - then build a custom solution that works exactly how you do business.
