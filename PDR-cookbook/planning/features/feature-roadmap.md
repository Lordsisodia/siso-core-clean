    requiredFields: [
      'companyName',
      'companyLogo',
      'businessDescription',
      'businessGoals'
    ],
    optionalFields: [
      'socialMediaLinks',

    ],
    unlocks: ['moodBoard']
  },
  
  moodBoard: {
    required: true,
    minimumImages: 5,
    maximumImages: 20,
    requiresTags: true,
    requiresCategories: false, // optional
    unlocks: ['appPlan']
  },
  
  appPlan: {
    required: true,
    requiresReview: true,
    requiresAcceptance: true,
    feedbackOptional: true,
    unlocks: ['timeline', 'agentTeams', 'payments']
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Notification System for Unlocks

```typescript
interface UnlockNotification {

  title: string;
  message: string;
  icon: string;
  action?: {
    label: string;
    route: string;
  };
  celebrationType?: 'confetti' | 'badge' | 'animation';
}

// Example notifications
const notifications: UnlockNotification[] = [
