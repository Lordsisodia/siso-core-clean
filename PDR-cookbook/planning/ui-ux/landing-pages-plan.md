    <>
      <HeroSection {...content.hero} />
      <PainPointsSection points={content.painPoints} />
      <FeaturesShowcase features={content.features} />
      <SocialProofSection 
        testimonials={testimonials}
        metrics={content.metrics}
      />
      <PricingSection packages={content.pricing} />
      <CTASection {...content.finalCTA} />
    </>
  );
};

// Industry-specific content loader
const useIndustryContent = (industry: string) => {
  const content = industryContent[industry];
  const { testimonials } = useTestimonials(industry);
  const { caseStudies } = useCaseStudies(industry);
  
  return {
    content,
    testimonials,
    caseStudies,
    isLoading: false
  };
};
```

### Animation Strategy

```typescript
// Scroll-triggered animations
const animationVariants = {
  fadeInUp: {
    hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
    visible: { 
      opacity: 1, 
      y: 0,
      transition: { duration: 0.6 }
    }
  },
  slideInLeft: {
    hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -50 },
    visible: { 
      opacity: 1, 
      x: 0,
      transition: { duration: 0.5 }
    }
  },
  scaleIn: {
    hidden: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 },
    visible: { 
      opacity: 1, 
      scale: 1,
      transition: { duration: 0.4 }
    }
  }
};

// Intersection observer for animations
const useScrollAnimation = () => {
  const controls = useAnimation();
  const [ref, inView] = useInView({
    threshold: 0.1,
    triggerOnce: true
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (inView) {
      controls.start('visible');
    }
  }, [controls, inView]);

  return { ref, controls };
};
```

### Form Handling

```typescript
// Conversion form component
const ConversionForm = ({ industry, formType }) => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
    businessName: '',
    industry: industry,
    projectTimeline: '',
    message: ''
  });

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    // Track conversion
    analytics.track('form_submission', {
      industry,
      formType,
      source: 'landing_page'
    });

    // Submit to Supabase
    await submitLead(formData);
    
    // Trigger success flow
    showSuccessModal();
    startOnboardingFlow();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
};
```
