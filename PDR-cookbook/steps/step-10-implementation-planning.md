# Step 10: Implementation Planning

## Purpose
Create detailed implementation plans for UI development, database setup, and feature integration.

## Input Data Location
- PDR document: `pdr/final.md`
- Feature database: `planning/features/database.json`
- UI/UX plans: `planning/ui-ux/`
- Technical plans: `planning/technical/`
- Implementation plans: `implementation/`

## Process
1. Create UI development plan:
   - Break down pages into components
   - Assign components to development tasks
   - Create component library
   - Define styling system
2. Plan database implementation:
   - Create database migration scripts
   - Define table relationships
   - Plan data seeding
3. Schedule feature development:
   - Prioritize features by dependency
   - Create development sprints
   - Assign resources to tasks
4. Establish deployment procedures:
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Environment configuration
   - Rollback procedures
5. Create monitoring and maintenance plans

## UI Development Plan
- Component breakdown for each page
- Styling system (CSS methodology)
- Responsive design approach
- Accessibility implementation
- Performance optimization

## Database Implementation Plan
- Migration scripts
- Seed data creation
- Backup procedures
- Performance optimization
- Security measures

## Feature Development Schedule
- Sprint planning
- Task breakdown
- Resource allocation
- Dependency mapping
- Milestone tracking

## Deployment Plan
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Environment setup (dev, staging, prod)
- Deployment scripts
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring setup

## Output Data Location
- UI development plan: `implementation/ui/`
- Database implementation plan: `implementation/database/`
- Feature development schedule: `implementation/features/`
- Deployment plan: `implementation/deployment/`
- Task assignments: `implementation/tasks/`

## Success Criteria
- Detailed implementation plans for all components
- Clear task breakdowns
- Resource allocation plan
- Deployment procedures
- Monitoring and maintenance plans

## Template Files Used
- `templates/ui-implementation-template.md`
- `templates/database-implementation-template.md`
- `templates/feature-schedule-template.md`
- `templates/deployment-plan-template.md`

## Next Steps
Begin implementation phase with human review checkpoints.
