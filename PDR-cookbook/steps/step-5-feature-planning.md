# Step 5: Feature Planning

## Purpose
Compile features from research and plan product versions with timeline.

## Input Data Location
- Client requirements: `client-input/structured.json`
- Competitor features: `research/competitors/features.md`
- Feature planning documents: `planning/features/`

## Process
1. Compile all potential features from:
   - Client requirements
   - Competitor analysis
   - Market research insights
2. Categorize features by type:
   - Core functionality
   - Differentiating features
   - Nice-to-have enhancements
3. Define version roadmap:
   - MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
   - Version 1 (short-term goals)
   - Version 2 (medium-term enhancements)
   - Version 3 (advanced features)
   - Mature version (long-term vision)
4. Create implementation timeline:
   - 1 day (concept validation)
   - 2 days (basic functionality)
   - 2 weeks (MVP)
   - 2 months (Version 1)
   - 2 years (Mature product)
5. Prioritize features for each version
