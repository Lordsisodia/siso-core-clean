## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ULTRA THINK

### Database Schema Optimization
```sql
-- Core Tables
clients (id, industry, onboarding_progress, plan_status)
partners (id, team_code, tier, performance_metrics)
projects (id, client_id, pdr_step, agent_assignments)
agents (id, specialization, current_task, performance)
mood_boards (id, client_id, colors, preferences, approved)
app_plans (id, client_id, features, approved, timeline)
```

### Real-time Updates System
```typescript
// WebSocket Architecture
const realtimeSystem = {
  agentUpdates: 'Live agent status changes',
  projectProgress: 'PDR step completions',
  tokenUsage: 'Budget tracking',
  notifications: 'Client/Partner alerts',
  collaboration: 'Agent team coordination'
}
```

### Progressive Unlocking Logic
```typescript
const unlockingRules = {
  moodBoard: 'onboarding >= 60%',
  appPlan: 'moodBoard.approved === true',
  timeline: 'appPlan.approved === true',
  agentTeams: 'timeline.started === true',
  financial: 'project.active === true'
