## üß† Why This Pricing Works

### 1. **Service Not Software**
Clients aren't buying "AI actions" - they're getting an AI development team that delivers actual websites/apps. This is familiar and valuable.

### 2. **Clear Deliverables**
- **Starter:** 1 project
- **Pro:** 3 projects/month  
- **Ultra:** 10 projects/month
- **Enterprise:** Unlimited

Easy to understand what you get.

### 3. **Speed as the Hook**
- Traditional agency: 4-6 weeks
- SISO Starter: 48 hours
- SISO Pro: 24 hours
- SISO Ultra: 12 hours
- Enterprise: Same day

Speed becomes more valuable at higher tiers.

### 4. **We Do Everything**
Client's only job:
1. Tell us what they want (onboarding)
2. Swipe on design preferences  
3. Approve the final result

That's it. We handle ALL development.
