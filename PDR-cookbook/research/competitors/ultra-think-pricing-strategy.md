## ⚡ The Decision Framework

**Choose this 4-tier structure because:**

1. **Simplicity Wins:** Free/Pro/Ultra/Enterprise is instantly understood
2. **Clear Progression:** Each tier is obviously better than the last
3. **Psychology Optimized:** Prices feel fair, upgrades feel natural
4. **Margin Protected:** 90%+ gross margins on paid tiers
5. **Growth Enabled:** Free tier feeds the funnel indefinitely

**The magic formula:** Give away what costs nothing (projects, storage), charge for what creates value (AI, features), and make upgrading feel like winning, not paying.
