# ULTRA THINK: Complete Solution Architecture for All Agency Problems

## ðŸ§  FIRST PRINCIPLES SOLUTION DESIGN

**Core Insight**: Every agency problem stems from 3 fundamental tensions:
1. **Trust vs Efficiency** (human relationships vs automated processes)
2. **Simplicity vs Power** (ease of use vs sophisticated capabilities)  
3. **Flexibility vs Standards** (customization vs systematic operation)

**Solution Philosophy**: Build solutions that RESOLVE these tensions, don't force trade-offs.
