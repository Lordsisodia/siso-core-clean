## Raw Feedback Transcript

Hey I'm gonna go through the app and all the pages and start giving back some feedback right? So firstly on the dashboard page I like the set up progress slider and how it shows all of the different things and the project hub not sure the point of the activity feed , I feel like it's kind of out of place since it's only our place cause it doesn't fit if you get what I'm saying like it's super high and they get started batch 103 thing on the bottom that's quite cool. Maybe we put that at the top second thing is to see that The four boxes at the top says revenue this month active projects pending tasks client satisfaction. I agree that these four boxes should be here but I'm not hundred percent sure what should be in the four boxes I get the active projects make sense figure out three boxes feedback for the dashboard page Now going onto the on boarding again for some reason on boarding actual element is White versus chat and voice call when you click on it fine but this is fine but the elements are all white inside so we should probably fix that and change it to make it fit the brown colours a bit more Fun I reckon it's good right now but it's pre-programmed responses. I reckon it should be a bit more AI on the steps. It's not actually an intelligent slider based based on the information with collected off of the client so I'll be a cool thing to add in, but that's pretty much everything for the client on board and Looking at it still got white elements not sure why it does probably don't need this and it's got two titles it says design preference discovery help us understand your design and style to create your brand. Not sure why that's there too and also I think it needs more work like you should be able to select what colours you want Like actually from a colour selector as well not just these cause these are like pre-programmed colours. I guess you could call it and also it would be nice if the colours are on the left-hand side and then the middle taking up majority to the space and the right hand side it shows like I don't know just a simple landing pagein a box and then click on the different colours. It changes them and changes and stuff like that. so I do think the mood board needs some extra thought into it not 100% happy with how it's laid out yeah now going over to the plan keep in mind we already made an app plan element where the element should be saved this is a good star. I like it and stuff like that, although when you click on the elements it goes black quite hard to see which body fix that the download PDF button should be in black and the icon in black so it contrast better with the white background look at what we have for the overview right and the overview we just want brief analysis and what the company is goals where stands to be and how we hope these goals plan obviously needs some more detailed and a bit more work obviously we might need to make some templates but we've already done in regards to the plan obviously when it is complicated, but that's a general gist if you can just add everything from that previous app to this app and you know just be better timeline but you should look at that we made a new one with 75 steps so you should input that in the current phase that should look nicer. Somehow should look nicer. Also the PDR steps and timeline when you click on each step I want a bit more of a detailed analysis on what the actual step is and even right now but you've got like two words actually look into the PDR steps and just put the whole sentence with a little sub sentence below so we the client has more information about what we're actually doing for them and what each of the steps are and also on top of that time taken and the right hand side of it give a time taken and estimated on the ones which have been done an estimated time on the ones that she had to be done and then estimated tokens on the one which are yet to be done and actual tokens on the ones which have been done and then maybe say how many files and all the sources they look through just a bit more information briefly like how many sources they look through how long you thought how many pages and files it made how many words it made related to this right many websites through stuff like this Priti I guess one thing I don't like to scrollbars I don't like how the main page can scroll down. There's no need since this task thing as a scroll anyway we should try and avoid Joel scrolls on a thing okay? On the agent teams we should I'm still on what we should put on here, but the general just is that it should be able to show all the tasks that I've completed I guess you know all the analysis and I guess yeah the agents that's good that it shows the agents but we should actually do some research into what agents are system uses so it actually like us uses real information and maybe it shows I mean because I know our system has different agent teams and then you got different agent specialists so I wanna show the specialist on this page and the agent teams we have working for the client do some more research and what information should actually be displayed on this page, but the UI is looking nice maybe some more time they've been running payments and billing we do need to think about what's actually gonna be on here but I guess the general just of what we want for this for CLIENT is the CLIENT can see what we're spending money on where the expenses are going, how much is been paid and guess where the expenses are going to cost us nicely on one page if you can and then also they can update payment method paying crypto for a discount. This is where everything gets handled care on that side if there's a payment due then it tells them how much they paid into that development this is cool. I think the page needs to fit a bit better though and this is good. I guess we need to find a way for the development page to be more space utilising space a bit better. Please testing the testing pages and the launch page we should look it's a bit simple right now. I don't actually know the whole point of this so maybe we should look into it and figure out what actually should so all these pages need to look at from the clients perspective or perspective what the client needs what we would want to give them as extras what we offer and all the Day involved and try and figure out what should actually go on these pages and help and support we made it previously it's alright but we also need to figure out what help and support goes on here and fix UI 3-D elements and documents page and not hundred percent sure that even take out the documents page but maybe we figure out if there's any other resources we should put in there for them right, maybe we have an automation page or something but yeah that's my feedback. I want you from this feedback to further note it down and then do a deep analysis on everything I'm talking about and make a whole new folder in the PDR. Call it analysis one because this is our first analysis you know last thing is the logo is broken so if you can make something else and logo with our colours are brand orange and black circle with like a lion in it facing with a crown and make it an SVG if you do this shit I'll just give you an image but let's see if you can do that
