# PDR Cookbook - Project Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete system for automatically generating Project Development Reports (PDRs) for client websites using AI agents. The system will follow predetermined steps to research, analyze, and plan website development projects.

## System Architecture
The PDR Cookbook will consist of:
1. Standardized steps for AI agents to follow
2. Templates for consistent output formats
3. Documentation for each step
4. Integration points for research tools and APIs

## Core Steps for PDR Generation

### Phase 1: Initial Client Analysis
1. **Client Information Collection**
   - Gather client business details, goals, and requirements
   - Document target market, location, and products/services
   - Save in structured format for AI processing

2. **Market Research**
   - Research client's industry and market statistics
   - Gather recent data about market trends
   - Document findings in standardized format

### Phase 2: Competitive Analysis
3. **Competitor Identification**
   - Identify direct and indirect competitors
   - Categorize competitors by market position

4. **Competitor Analysis**
   - Use Playwright/MCP headless browsers to analyze competitor websites
   - Screenshot websites and analyze UI elements
   - Document features, functionalities, and design elements
   - Extract value propositions and marketing messages

### Phase 3: Project Planning
5. **Feature Planning**
   - Compile features from competitor analysis
   - Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
   - Plan version roadmap (v1, v2, v3, mature)
   - Create timeline for implementation

6. **UI/UX Planning**
   - Plan all pages and their elements
   - Define UI components and interactions
   - Create wireframes and mockups
   - Document color schemes and design guidelines

7. **Technical Architecture**
   - Database planning and structure
   - API integration planning (Supabase, Clerk, Stripe, etc.)
   - Technical stack decisions
   - Security considerations

### Phase 4: Documentation & Testing
8. **PDR Assembly**
   - Compile all research into standardized PDR format
   - Organize findings in predictable structure
   - Create to-do lists for implementation

9. **Testing Framework**
   - Define UI testing procedures using Playwright
   - Create test plans for functionality
   - Establish feedback loops for iteration

10. **Implementation Planning**
    - Create build plans for UI development
    - Plan database implementation
    - Schedule testing phases
    - Prepare for human review checkpoints

## Directory Structure
- `/steps` - Individual step implementations
- `/templates` - PDR and document templates
- `/docs` - Detailed documentation for each step
- `/pdf` - Generated PDR documents
- `/wireframes` - UI planning and mockups
- `/testing` - Test plans and procedures

## Agent Coordination
The system will employ multiple specialized AI agents:
- Research Agents (market and competitor analysis)
- UI/UX Agents (design and wireframing)
- Technical Agents (database and API planning)
- Documentation Agents (PDR assembly)
- Testing Agents (quality assurance)

## Data Flow
1. Client input → Structured data storage
2. Research agents → Market/competitor data
3. Analysis engines → Feature and requirement definitions
4. Planning modules → UI/database/API plans
5. Documentation system → Assembled PDR
6. Testing framework → Quality validation
7. Feedback loops → Iterative improvements

## Implementation Notes
- All steps must specify data input/output locations
- Each step should have clear success criteria
- Templates must be predictable for AI processing
- System should support human review checkpoints
- Generated PDRs should be exportable as PDF
